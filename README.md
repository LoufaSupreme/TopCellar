## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Tracking sales opportunities across time can be challenging, especially for sales professionals that work in the field or within an industry with long sales cycles. Often, new opportunities to sell product or help a customer arise while the salesman is away from their desk (e.g. at an on-site sales call, driving, etc).  Sometimes a minor sale several months ago suddenly develops into a larger opportunity, and the customer expects you to remember everything that was discussed/evaluated/decided at the initial onset.

The salesman needs to keep track of what's been happening in his territory.  This often takes the form of impromptu notes written on scraps of paper in his car, random photos snapped with his cellphone, a half-assed attempt to file emails in Outlook, or a multitude of half-completed excel spreadsheets across several folders and devices. In short, a mess.

## OBJECTIVE
This app aims to help address the common sales problem of tracking sales activity by providing a persistent, easy to use, secure and accessible centralized database for all sales "events" (phonecalls, new opportunities, new ideas, failed initiatives, photos, roledex of customers and contacts, etc).  It will also act as a hub to track KPIs across time (opportuntities generated, conversion rate, new customers engaged/clinched, etc).
